# os-setup
Directions for customizing Operating System after basic install. (For faculty and staff use only)

- These modifications are reccommended based on several years of experience with Ubuntu and interaction with Cadets working on ROS. 
- The biggest challenge most of us face is that we work on multiple projects and machines which are under the care of Cadets. 
- This common baseline has made it significantly easier to assist the Cadets, while at the same time, mainting certain software standards.
- The rationale behind each step is explained. Perform only those steps you find pertinent to your application.
